# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

# strategy:
#   matrix:
#     linux:
#       operatingSystem: 'ubuntu-latest'
#     mac:
#       operatingSystem: 'macos-latest'
     

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - bash: echo "Do the build"
- stage: DevDeploy
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - bash: echo "Start Dev deploy Job"
  - deployment: DevDeployJob
    environment: Dev
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
            - script: echo deploy to ${environment}
- stage: QADeploy
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - bash: echo "Start QA deploy Job"
